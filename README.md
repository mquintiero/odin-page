# The Odin Project webpage

I had to replicate a webpage design guided by the screenshot of a page and some details about the font size and colors.

Page: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png
Details: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/a38403e7d81cc8305af16ac48985cfbde87834d6/foundations/html_css/flexbox/project-landing-page/imgs/02.png

With this page I had to put to test the knowledge about HTML and CSS (mainly Flexbox) I learnt through the course.
